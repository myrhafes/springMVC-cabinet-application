# springMVC cabinet application

I worked on this application when i learned spring and spring boot, so i started with a simple mvc application for patient in cabinet.
The doctor can make the simple operation CRUD on patients, he can create, read, update and delete patients.

I use :
- spring ioc
- dependance injection
- Mysql (I test the application with H2 database)
- Thymleaf 
- Lambok (generate getters, setters, constructors, Tostring method)
- spring data
- jpa
- hibernet
- spring security
